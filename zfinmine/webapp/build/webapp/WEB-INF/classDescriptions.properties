Phenotype=Describes a phenotype for a genotype.
Genotype=A description of the genetic information carried by an organism. In the simplest case, "genotype" may refer to the information carried at a single locus, as in A/A, A/a, or a/a.
ZFATerm=An anatomical part or stage in Danio rerio.
Antibody=A protein produced by cells of the immune system that binds to an antigen. See the Figure at NHGRI. See also monoclonal antibody. 
Construct=
EST=Expressed Sequence Tag. A partial sequence of a randomly chosen cDNA, obtained from the results of a single DNA sequencing reaction. ESTs are used to identify transcribed regions in genomic sequence, to characterize patterns of gene expression in the tissue that was the source of the cDNA and as markers for genetic mapping.
EFG=Engineered foreign gene like GFP.
Environment=All the conditions an organism is subjected to in an expression or phenotype experiment.
Expression=The conditions of an expression experiment including assay, gene, probe, etc...
ExpressionResult=The results of an expression experiment including what stage and anatomical part the expression is found or not found in.
ExternalLink=
Feature=An sequence varient like an allele.
Figure=In a publication or data load, an image or group of images with a caption.
GenotypeEnvironment=The combination of Genotypes and Environment.  Mainly used to describe the conditions of an expression or phenotype experiment.
GenotypeFeature=Lists a particular allele in a specific genotype.
Journal=A Journal like Development that contains publications.
Marker=1. Any biological feature that can be positioned with respect to other features on a chromosome, by genetic, physical or other mapping methods. For example, a gene, anonymous DNA segment, mutation, or phenotype. 2. A feature that distinguishes a particular biological state. For example, an expression profile of natural or engineered genes, or a characteristic morphology. 3. In ZFIN, a Marker is an object for which unique official nomenclature must be assigned. Markers in ZFIN can be of type: gene, mutant, BAC/YAC, cDNA, EST, SSLP, SSR, STS, RAPD, RFLP.
MarkerRelationship=A relationship for a marker, like the relationship between clones and genes.
Morpholino=An antisense oligonucleotide modified to make them more stable than RNA. Morpholinos are used to inhibit translation or splicing of particular mRNAs. The resulting reduction in gene function is sometimes casually referred to as a knock-down.
PATOTerm=A phenotypic qualifying term.
ProbeLibrary=A library of probes.
RAPD=Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA. Segments of DNA amplified by PCR using short primers with sequences chosen at random that are used as polymorphic markers for mapping. 
SSLP=A short (up to several hundred base pairs) segment of DNA that consists of multiple tandem repeats of a two or three base-pair sequence. SSLPs expand and contract (that is, add or remove repeat units) with a frequency much higher than other types of mutations, making them useful as polymorphic markers in closely related zebrafish strains. SSLPs are also sometimes called microsatellite markers.
